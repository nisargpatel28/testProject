# Favourite Movies

Your task is to build a react application that allows the user to search for a movie and display results. The user can then favourite a movie so that it shows up in a separate list titled "favourites". They should also be allowed to unfavourite the movie if they change their mind.

A starter react app with some default styling has been provided for you. See Example.png to view our rendition of the end result.
